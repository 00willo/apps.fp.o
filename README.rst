apps.fp.o
=========

A landing page for http://apps.fedoraproject.org

Idea
----

Right now, the apps side of Fedora Infrastructure feels scattered and all over
the place.  It seems like I learn that a new thing exists every couple weeks and
it seems like there's not a single easy place where you can stumble into
everything.

That's what this page is for.  I'm kind of barging ahead with it without
consulting anyone else yet but I fully intend to take in criticism (and patches,
really!) to make it more awesome and reflective of the community's desires.

You can see a demo version up at http://threebean.org/apps.fp.o/ right now (I
think...)

Stop into ``#fedora-apps`` on freenode and say "hello".
